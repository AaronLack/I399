These creatures are very well adapted to colder climates. Red pandas use their fluffy tails to wrap up in during winters in the mountains, and they even have fur on the pads of their feet to help keep them warm.",

Mother bears give birth to cubs, typically twins, while still in their winter dens. The cubs stay with their mothers for over two years, growing in size and learning how to find food. A powerful sense of smell is important adaptation that helps bears locate food. Bears have been known to smell food from up to a mile away.",
